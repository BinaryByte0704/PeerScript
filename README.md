This is a collaborative real-time code editor built using React for the frontend, Express.js and Socket.IO for the backend, and WebSocket for real-time functionality. Multiple users can join a room, collaborate, and see real-time changes to code.

Features
Real-time collaborative code editing
Synchronizes code changes between clients
User management with room-based connections
Code synchronization and broadcasting of updates
Lightweight UI built with React
Project Structure
bash
Copy code
- src/              # React frontend code
  - components/     # React components
  - Actions.js      # Socket event types
- build/            # Production build files
- server.js         # Backend server using Express and Socket.IO
- package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (v6 or later)
yarn (optional, for managing packages)
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project with the following content:

bash
Copy code
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
PORT=5000
The REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL should point to your backend server URL.

Available Scripts
In the package.json file, the following scripts are available to manage the project:

npm run start:front
Runs the React frontend in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

bash
Copy code
npm run start:front
npm run start
This command builds the React app and then starts the server in production mode.

bash
Copy code
npm run start
npm run build
Builds the React app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

bash
Copy code
npm run build
npm run server:dev
Starts the Express.js backend with nodemon in development mode. The server will reload when files are changed.

bash
Copy code
npm run server:dev
npm run server:prod
Starts the Express.js backend in production mode.

bash
Copy code
npm run server:prod
npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode for the frontend (React).

bash
Copy code
npm test
npm eject
This will remove the single build dependency from your project. Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!

bash
Copy code
npm eject
How to Run
Development Mode
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
npm run server:dev
Start the frontend:
bash
Copy code
npm run start:front
Open http://localhost:3000 in the browser. The frontend will automatically connect to the backend via WebSocket for real-time collaboration.
Production Mode
Build the React app:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
Start the production server:
bash
Copy code
npm run server:prod
Open http://localhost:5000 in the browser.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React, CodeMirror (for the code editor)
Backend: Express.js, Socket.IO
WebSocket: For real-time communication
Deployment: Node.js server to run both frontend and backend
